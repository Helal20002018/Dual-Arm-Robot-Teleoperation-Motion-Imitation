# Dual-Arm-Robot-Teleoperation-Motion-Imitation

--Project Overview

This project was developed on the AgileX Piper, a dual-arm robotic platform.
The goal was to enable the robot to learn tasks directly from human hand movements using a master–slave teleoperation framework, while ensuring accuracy, smoothness, and real-time control.

-- My Contributions

Master–Slave Control: Implemented a framework where one arm acts as the master and the other as the slave, imitating human-like movements.

Motion Learning from Human Demonstration: Enabled the robot to replicate hand movements for task execution.

Simulation Environment: Built a complete simulation using Gazebo and Rviz for testing teleoperation before real deployment.

MoveIt Integration: Controlled and planned robot arm trajectories in both simulation and real time.

Calibration: Developed new calibration methods for improved accuracy in tracking hand movements.

Smooth Motion Optimization: Refined control algorithms to make the robot’s movements smoother and closer to natural hand gestures.

-- Tools & Technologies

Frameworks: ROS / ROS 2, MoveIt, Gazebo, Rviz

Methods: Teleoperation, Motion Imitation, Calibration, Trajectory Optimization
